      Exposes a simple directory-based keystore with a single XML file that maps
      certificate aliases to files. Keys and certificates are expected to be
      PEM-encoded regular files.

    <li>
      Implicit compatibility with ACME systems; ACME clients can simply copy
      certificate files into the directory and, as long as the certificates have
      an entry in the XML index file, the new certificates will become
      available as soon as the Keystore is reloaded.

    <li>
      A small, easily auditable codebase with use of modularity for correctness.

    <li>
      An extensive automated test suite with high coverage.

    <li>
      Platform independence. No platform-dependent code is included in any form.
